1. create an array boolean of visited and set all the values to zero.
2. create an another array to store the weights of the vertices.
3. create another array to store Parent of each vertices.
4. for ( u : V ) // u := each vertex and V:= Total vertices
     a = Min( Weight[]); // a is index
     visited[a] = true;
    for -> Travel each neighbor vertex of the a and check the weights of the neighbors from is less or not.
     if yes, then set the weights of the neighbors and set the Parent also to the a.
    end. 
5. end.
